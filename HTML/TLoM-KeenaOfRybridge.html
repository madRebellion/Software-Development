        <p>"They say the sword or axe should be an extension of your body to maximise your strength. If you need a
            weapon to
            be strong, then you are simply a weakling. Me? I don't need your trinkets. I am <b>THE WEAPON!</b>"

            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>Keena was born and raised in a small town called <i><b>Rybridge</b></i>. It is known in the region for
                its
                carpentry and excellent wooden sculpts.

                Keena is the only child of Venn and Patch - with Venn the financial advisor to the mayor and Patch is an
                injured
                quartermaster - where she lived quite a spoilt life.
                Whatever she wanted, she got. Well... within reason of course. Keena was always cheerful, energetic
                (maybe a
                bit
                too energetic...) and brash which meant she often found herself
                in trouble for breaking things and almost (so very almost...) harming others around her. But she did it
                with
                a
                big smile and a cute little giggle! That's all that matter though right?
                The innocence of a child knows no bounds!
            </p>

            <p>
                Fastforwarding to her late teenage years (16), Keena and her peers were gearing up to
                learn about the importance of self-defence and the world beyond the hills
                - a tradition in Rybridge - when it became painfully clear that Keena was not a good combatant. Keena
                couldn't
                quite grasp the basics of weapon holding and use, often taking an
                eternity just to swing the sword and forgetting about the shield entirely. Frustrated at this, Keena
                demands
                (from instructor Merkin) that she practice without the shield and
                bulky armour so that she can move more freely and with speed. Merkin denies this demand and reminds
                Keena
                that
                these pieces are designed to protect and help you survive if the time
                ever arose. Even more frustrated now, Keena forcefully throws her training gear onto the ground and
                proclaims
                that Instructor Merkin has lost touch with what it means to protect - remember
                Keena's father is a quatermaster - because of his time out of the Ryguards and boldly challenges Merkin
                to a
                simple fight. Keena is unarmed and unprotected here by the way. Merkin, again,
                rejects but Keena was already mid-punch. Keena made up so much ground in such a short period of time
                that
                not
                all the students realised she moved by the time she made physical contact with
                Merkin. And what punch it was. Merkin just can't react. He does eventually but it takes him a hot second
                or
                two
                to realise he was hit.
            </p>

            <p>
                Red with rage, Keena was on the offensive, but not in control. Her feelings of uselessness, lack of
                freedom
                when
                fighting and overall anger have taken over her. She was not - and could not -
                thinking, only attacking. Keena was fighting hand-to-hand and armourless against a well-known decorated
                ex-guard
                using his signiture cross-long shield and polearm. But it seems like Keena
                has the upperhand. Not weighed down and only limited by her own speed, she is quite nippy it seems when
                she
                wants to be. But Merkin is done with this disobedience and swings his shield to
                knock Keena flying. Just one swing from this 'old man' was enough to end it. Oof, thats rough buddy. The
                attack
                takes a lot out of Keena but she's not done yet! Except she kinda is... Merkin
                demands that she stop and to spend more time practicing and maybe she will get the hang of it.
                <i>"Practice
                    makes perfect Keena! You won't master it first try!"</i>. Deflated and angry, Keena
                leaves but not without first promising that she will prove him wrong and that she can protect herself
                without
                the need for weapons. <i>"I'll show you! I'll show all of you! I can do this by myself
                    - and with my own way! I don't want your stupid sword beacuse I will be the weapon instead!"</i>
            </p>

            <p>
                She storms out and begins training by herself.
            </p>

            <p>
                At age 24, Keena joins the Abasteles√© tournement of warriors and her adventure offically starts here.
                No-one
                will
                judge her now.
